# Minesweeper
This was a project given in one of my first-year subject.

We had to do a minesweeper game mainly using ADTs. We used ADTs for creating the coordinates, a "xorshift" generator, a parcel and the field (here each coordinate was associated to a parcel). Since this was my second project I hadnâ€™t a lot of experience which led to having some difficulties such as not breaking some abstraction barriers (especially in the ADT field) and commenting my work.
